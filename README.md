# Marketing-Analytics
- Developed a survey to gather data on customer preferences for bleach usage
- Cleaned survey response data to remove invalid responses
- Analyzed survey data using Marketing Engineering add-in on Excel to develop segments based on customer preference responses
- Two key segments emerged: i) Traditional bleach users ii) "Green" bleach users
- Developed end-to-end targeting and positioning strategies for both the customer segments, with detailed branding and marketing campaigns


The purpose of the project is to apply the marketing analytics tool to explore a marketing problem you are interested.   
1)  Select a marketing problem (opportunity) that requires marketing research for further decision making (e.g., segmentation & targeting, positioning, new product design). Conduct research on the background information using situation analysis. You are suggested to collaborate with a business client to identify the marketing problem.  
2) Design the research method. For example, you may design an online survey (e.g., questionnaires) using Google Forms (or Qaultrics etc.) to collect the needed information. You may also consider to use Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for data collection. 
3) Analyze the data using marketing analytics methods (e.g., segmentation & discriminant analysis, perceptual & preference mapping, conjoint analysis) and make marketing decisions based on the main findings.
